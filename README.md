# AESâ€‘128 Encryption Tool

âœ¨ **Built from scratch by Shivam Rai**

This is a Python implementation of the AESâ€‘128 encryption algorithm.  
It encrypts and decrypts single 16â€‘byte plaintext blocks with a 128â€‘bit key, demonstrating how AES works internally.

## ðŸ“¦ Features
- Fully self-contained Python script â€” no external libraries required
- Supports encryption & decryption from the command line
- Uses standard Sâ€‘box, inverse Sâ€‘box, key expansion, and round transformations
- Simple and clean structure, easy to understand
